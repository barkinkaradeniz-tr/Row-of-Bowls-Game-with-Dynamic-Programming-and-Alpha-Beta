# Row-of-Bowls-Game-with-Dynamic-Programming-and-Alpha-Beta-Pruning
## About Repository
Row of Bowls game is played for both sides by computer. Both sides chooses always the optimal option for themselves. If the output is positive, the first player wins. If negative second player wins. Zero(0) as output is considered as tie.

The game can be executed with both Dynamic Programming and recursive Alpha-Beta-Pruning. Additionally a run time test is added for random games with more bowls to see the complexity difference.

Following techniques were used to implement this tasks:
- Dynamic Programming
- Alpha-Beta-Pruning

## Row of Bowls Game
Players alternately choose one of the outer bowls and take the marbles in it. At the end, the difference of the collected marbles is counted. The player with more marble wins.

## Execute
